# M09 Implementing a New Model Exercise: SVM

**Description:**

Here is a repository of files dealing with the implementation of SVM, or the Support Vector Machine algorithm. The ETL and processes of the data and model are documented along with the coded model, the presentation slides, and a implementation of the dataset using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for comparison. The dataset used is Cars93 and is linked below.

**Files:**
1. M09_SVM.ipynb: Coded model of the Cars93 dataset using the SVM algorithm
2. M09_SVM_to_NB.ipynb: Coded model implementing the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm with the same Cars93 dataset
3. SVM-Process.pdf: All ETL steps and processes used for the model
4. SVM_Assessment.pdf: Presentation slides of our processes
